1) Movie category while entering value not in the list throwing error -Done by declaring the variable
on_list as a local one inside the function itself

2) Year is not randomnly selecting due to try and except block - Done by making 1 as a choice for 
random selection

3) Genres need not be static one.. Make it dynamic from the api call itself..

4) Some movie and year combinations doesn't give up any results.. check on it.. - Done by using some workaround
in the form of if else loop

5) for the above point, user should be presented with the menu only if the options are selected by user, else the
random needs to re-shuffled inside itself...
